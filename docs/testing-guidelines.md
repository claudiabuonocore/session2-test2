# Testing Guidelines for TODO App

## Testing Principles

- All new features must include appropriate tests.
- Tests should be easy to read, maintain, and update as the codebase evolves.
- Use descriptive test names and clear assertions.
- Keep tests isolated and independent from each other.
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions, components, or modules in isolation.
- Cover edge cases and error handling.

### Integration Tests
- Test the interaction between multiple components or modules.
- Ensure that data flows correctly through the app.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Simulate real user scenarios from the UI to the backend.
- Validate that the app works as expected in a production-like environment.

## Coverage and Maintenance
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for core features.
- Regularly review and update tests as features change.
- Remove obsolete tests and add new ones for updated functionality.
